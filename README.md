# Workflow
### Debuggable script language for interoperation with C++ using reflection.

Using this library requires you to use C++ source files (you should put them together) in
   * The [Import folder](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Workflow/tree/master/Import) for Vlpp.
   * The [Release folder](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Workflow/tree/master/Release) for this library.

All other files are for librari development only.
